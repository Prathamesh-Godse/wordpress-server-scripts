## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold a standard of respect and fairness towards all contributors. Be kind and constructive.

## I Have a Question

Before asking a question, please check the project's [README.md](./README.md) and the existing [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourProjectName/issues) to see if your question has already been answered.

If your question is unique, you can open a new issue. Please use a clear title and description.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- **Use the GitHub Issues search** to check if the bug has already been reported.
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourProjectName/issues/new).
- **Be specific** in your report. Include:
  - Your operating system.
  - Steps to reproduce the bug.
  - What you expected to happen vs. what actually happened.
  - Screenshots or error messages, if possible.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Check the issues list to see if the enhancement has already been suggested.
- Open a new issue and clearly describe the enhancement:
  - Why should this feature be added?
  - How should it work?
  - Any examples or mockups, if applicable.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues labeled `good first issue`. These are typically well-defined and easier to tackle for new contributors.

## The Contribution Workflow

This project uses a **Forking Workflow** with **Protected Branches**. This means no one can push directly to the `main` branch. All changes must be submitted via a Pull Request (PR).

### Step 1: Fork the Project

1. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the main project page on GitHub.
2. This creates a personal copy of the repository under your GitHub account (`https://github.com/YourUsername/YourProjectName`).

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork

Clone your forked repository to your local machine. **Make sure to clone YOUR fork, not the original project.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourProjectName.git
cd YourProjectName
```

### Step 3: Set Upstream Remote

Add the original project as a remote called `upstream`. This allows you to sync changes from the main project later.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/YourUsername/YourProjectName.git
```

To sync your local `main` branch with the latest changes from the main project:

```bash
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

### Step 4: Create a Feature Branch

**Always create a new branch for your work.** Never work directly on the `main` branch.

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch. Name it descriptively.
git checkout -b feat/short-description
# Examples:
# git checkout -b fix/login-bug
# git checkout -b docs/update-readme
```

### Step 5: Make Your Changes

Make your code or documentation changes. Test them thoroughly.

### Step 6: Commit Your Changes

Stage and commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message.

```bash
# Stage all changed files
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication logic"
# See our commit message guidelines below.
```

### Step 7: Push to Your Fork

Push your new branch to your forked repository on GitHub.

```bash
git push origin feat/short-description
```

### Step 8: Open a Pull Request

1. Go to **your fork** on GitHub.
2. You will see a banner suggesting you open a Pull Request for your recently pushed branch. Click **Compare & pull request**.
3. **Crucially ensure:**
   - The **base repository** is `YourUsername/YourProjectName` with the `main` branch.
   - The **head repository** is `YourUsername/YourProjectName` with your `feat/short-description` branch.
4. Fill in the PR template:
   - **Title:** Summarize the change.
   - **Description:** Explain what you did and why. Use **"Closes #123"** to automatically link and close the related issue.
5. Click **Create Pull Request**.

The project maintainer will then review your PR. You may be asked to make changes. You can do so by pushing more commits to the same branch on your forkâ€”the PR will update automatically.

## Style Guides

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style. This helps automate generating changelogs.

- **Format:** `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
- **Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
- **Example:**
  - `feat(auth): add login with Google OAuth`
  - `fix(api): correct user data validation error`
